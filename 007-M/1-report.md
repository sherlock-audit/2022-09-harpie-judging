# Usage of deprecated transfer() can result in revert.

## Summary
The function withdrawPayments() is used by the Owners to withdraw the fees.

## Vulnerability Detail
transfer() uses a fixed amount of gas, which was used to prevent reentrancy. However this limit your protocol to interact with others contracts that need more than that to process the transaction.

Specifically, the withdrawal will inevitably fail when:
1.The withdrawer smart contract does not implement a payable fallback function.
2.The withdrawer smart contract implements a payable fallback function which uses more than 2300 gas units.
3.The withdrawer smart contract implements a payable fallback function which needs less than 2300 gas units but is called through a proxy that raises the callâ€™s gas usage above 2300.

## Impact
transfer() uses a fixed amount of gas, which can result in revert.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use call instead of transfer(). Example:
(bool succeeded, ) = _to.call{value: _amount}("");
require(succeeded, "Transfer failed.");

## Lead Senior Watson

Fair considering recipient may be a contract with custom logic for `receive()`. But this is definitely recoverable if the fee recipient wasn't able to receive funds.

## Harpie Team

Moved to .call. Fix [here](https://github.com/Harpieio/contracts/pull/4/commits/655834654b5dc1225e9d2fcd2c07b00401aeac3b). 

## Lead Senior Watson

Confirmed fix.
