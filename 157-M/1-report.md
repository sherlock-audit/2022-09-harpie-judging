## Use safeTransfer/safeTransferFrom consistently instead of transfer/transferFrom

It is good to add a require() statement that checks the return value of token transfers or to use something like OpenZeppelinâ€™s safeTransfer/safeTransferFrom unless one is sure the given token reverts in case of a failure. Failure to do so will cause silent failures of transfers and affect token accounting in contract.

```
contracts/Vault.sol:159:        feeController.transfer(_amount); // Use safetransfer instead of transfers.
contracts/Vault.sol:137:        IERC721(_erc721Address).transferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, _id); 
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps:

Consider using safeTransfer/safeTransferFrom or require() consistently.
