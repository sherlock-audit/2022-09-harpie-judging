## Vulnerability Detail
Users arenâ€™t refunded any excess ETH funds if they send more than the required payment. It becomes unfairly taken by the Vault as fees.

Consider either ensuring strict equality
```solidity
require(msg.value == totalPrice, 'invalid total price');
```
or refunding users with the excess funds.
