### Proof of concept

Both functions allow `msg.value` to be more than the expected fee to pay. There is no need to allow users to overpay since there will be no benefit to them.

### Impact

This can result in a user paying more ETH than it was needed, so basically donating ETH to the vault even though it wasnâ€™t his goal

**Recommendation**

Make the checks for `msg.value` to be `==` not `>=`
