# No refund for excess eth

## Summary
No refund for excess eth
## Vulnerability Detail
In the withdrawERC20 and withdrawERC721 functions of the Vault contract, excess eth will not be refunded.
Also, if reduceERC20Fee/reduceERC721Fee and withdrawERC20/withdrawERC721 are executed in the same block, the reduced fee will not be refunded to the user.
## Impact
Users may lose excess eth
## Code Snippet

```
    function withdrawERC20(address _originalAddress, address _erc20Address) payable external {
        ...
        require(msg.value >= _erc20WithdrawalAllowances[_originalAddress][_erc20Address].fee, "Insufficient payment.");
        ...
    }
    function withdrawERC721(address _originalAddress, address _erc721Address, uint256 _id) payable external {
       ...
        require(msg.value >= _erc721WithdrawalAllowances[_originalAddress][_erc721Address][_id].fee, "Insufficient payment.");
       ...
    }
